== Setting up
Before we start the lab, its important that you read the following instructions carefully. These instructions will be refered from the rest of the content if you need to come back to them.

The lab environment is setup with out of the box components from RHMI(Red Hat Managed Integration) also know as Integreatly. Incase you would like to create this workshop your self you would need to get the "Integreatly workshop cluster" from RHPDS. Details on that later in the Appendix.


== Creating your workspace
Ensure you are logged into to Che/CodeReady with your evalsXX. (here XX should be replaced with your user number e.g. 01,02.. etc.)

Once logged in, you should see your own dashboard.  
Following instructions will guide you in creating a workspace for this lab. 

Create a workspace by pressing the "Add Workspace" button.

You should now see a new workspace page, lets configure it for our lab. 

=== Step 1: Name your workspace. 
In my case I just add my initials before it. You can choose anything or leave it as is.

=== Step 2: Choose your Stack
Whats a Stack?
A stack is a runtime configuration for a workspace. It contains a runtime recipe, meta information like tags, description, environment name, and security policies. Stacks are displayed within the user dashboard and stack tags are used to filter the project code samples that are available. A stack's recipe can be Kubernetes YAML, a Dockerfile or a Docker Compose file that will create a runtime to be embedded into the workspace. You can use any of Che's 30+ built-in stacks or author your own unique stack for your work.

Choosing our stack for the lab; select the Spring boot Stack as shown in the image below. * You do not need to press the "Add Stack" button; rather just select the stack by clicking on its name

=== Step 3: Import the lab project from github
As showin in the image below, select `GIT` and press the add button to add the repo for this lab

https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/sso-kubernetes-workshop.git
----

Press the Create Workspace button, and wait for the following dialog to appear. 
Now open the workspace and let it load. It can take some time. Time for any questions?

== Working with Che/CodeReady
The following are a few steps that will help you compelete the setup for your environment.
If you are familiar with IDE (Integrated Development Environments), Che/CodeReady is no exception. It runs in your browser and has similar experince to running any IDE. 

Run the following commands in the terminal to ensure that your environment is up and running, replace evalsXX with your username


[source, bash]
----

oc login https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u <evalsXX> -p <PASSWORD>

----

We are going to use a specific project to host all the microservices developed in this workshop. A `project` is a
namespace making easy to organize your different applications in OpenShift. In a terminal run:

[source, bash]
----
oc new-project <evalsXX>-sso-kubernetes-workshop
oc policy add-role-to-user view admin -n $(oc project -q)
oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default
----

The first instruction creates the project. The 3 last instructions grant permissions in order to use all the
OpenShift capabilities.

In the OpenShift Web Console, you should see the newly created project. Click on it. It's empty, which is perfectly fine for the moment, we will be deploying applications into it as well as the Red Hat Singel Sign-On.
