So you have by now learnt how Red Hat SSO works, how to deploy a Spring app and alot more. Now its time to learn how Quarkus can secure your applications. 
In this excercise we are going to bring back our JS Console, and add some end points so that we can communicate between the front end Java script client and the backend. 

In this example, we build a very simple microservice which offers two endpoints:

<1> /api/users

<2> /api/admin

These endpoints are protected and can only be accessed if a client is sending a bearer token along with the request, which must be valid (e.g.: signature, expiration and audience) and trusted by the microservice. We will configure this in our keycloak server to ensure that backend services can be reached from the front end JS Console. The bearer token is issued by a Keycloak Server and represents the subject to which the token was issued for. For being an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, the token also references the client acting on behalf of the user.

- The /api/users endpoint can be accessed by any user with a with a valid token. 

- The /api/admin as the name denotes can only be accessed by admin users.

Lets start by first creating a new openshift project. 
Remember to `replace evalsXX with your username`

[source, bash]
----
oc new-project <evalsXX>-quarkus
----

Switch to this new project in your openshift console. the rest of the guide assumes the new SSO instance in this project.

Lets create a new keycloak application
- Open the template.json file in the directory keycloak.

- Copy the contents of the template file

- Goto the openshift console and press the `add to project` button and then `Import YAML/JSON`

- Paste the content and press next.

- Ensure the following parameters are filled in:
<1> Keycloak Administrator Username

<2> Keycloak Administrator Password

<3> Namespace used for DNS discovery : this is your development project for quarkus which should be something like this: e.g. evals01-quarkus 

And then press create

image::keycloak_create.png[Keycloak Template]

Wait for the installation to be finished. 

Perfect now we have the keycloak running. Lets login with our admin user account. 
And lets create a new realm. 
In the keycloak directory is a realm file, you should load that file when creating a new realm. It will load all the necessary settings. 
Once loaded, it will show you a success message. 

Perfect now we have keycloak all set for our applicaiton. Lets go ahead and make one. 
We have already added a sample project `security-openid-connect-quickstart` its a quick start project with some code already provided. We will review this code and make some changes to it and finally deploy it.

Here is an example our configuration file for our application: 
[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus <1>
quarkus.oidc.client-id=backend-service <2>
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret <3>

# DEBUG console logging
quarkus.log.console.enable=true
#quarkus.log.console.format=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c{2.}]] (%t) %s%e%n
#quarkus.log.console.level=DEBUG

# TRACE file logging
quarkus.log.file.enable=true
#quarkus.log.file.path=/tmp/trace.log
quarkus.log.file.level=TRACE
quarkus.log.file.format=%d{HH:mm:ss} %-5p [%c{2.}]] (%t) %s%e%n
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.smallrye.jwt".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.undertow.request.security".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.smallrye.jwt".level=TRACE

----

<1> Open the application.properties file, and change the value of the property `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` to the newly deployed keycloak server url

<2> this is the Client name in our keycloak server, quite similar to our JS Console app in our previous excercise which was called `js-console`

<3> Since this is a backend service, it also use credentials, anyone without these credentials will not be able to call the server. even if they had a from the keycloak server. this is important since we will need this in our JS Console app too.

Lets verify our Admin end point
[source, java]
----

//TODO
@Path("/api/admin") <1>

// TODO
@Authenticated <2>


public class AdminResource {

    @GET
    // TODO
    @RolesAllowed("admin") <3>
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String admin() {
        return "granted";
    }
}
----

Open the `AdminResource.java` and add make the following ammendments.

<1> Path denotes the path of this api. hence when a rest call is made it can be retrieved from /api/admin

<2> Lets also make sure that @Authenticated is also added, since that ensures that we are authenticated for this entire /api/admin end point.

<3> Lastly we also want to make sure that Admin users can access this end point so we add @RolesAllowed


[source, java]
----
@Path("/api/users") <1>
public class UsersResource {

    @Inject <2>
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @RolesAllowed("user") <3>
    @Path("/me") <4>
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @NoCache
    public User me() {
        return new User(identity); <5>
    }

    public class User {

        private final String userName;

        User(SecurityIdentity identity) { <6>
            this.userName = identity.getPrincipal().getName();
        }

        public String getUserName() {
            return userName;
        }
    }
}

----

Review the following points, and ensure to make changes to the `UserResource.java`

<1> @Path denotes the api path for the REST calls 

<2> @Inject is used to inject objects into the code using the dependency injection like CDI. This ensures that we have an indetity of the user which is authenticated against keycloak, this was we can get more information about the user data.

<3> @RolesAllowed ensures that our method is only accessable by the Role type `user`.

<4> @Path defines the further api path to /me. so the complete path now for this method call will be /api/users/me

<5> The user method will return the User data by passing the identity of the logged in user. I our case we are only interested in the role.

<6> We also create a user class to get the details of the user. We pass the identity to it so we can extract information from the context. 


Okay perfect, so by now we have prepared the code. 
Lets take a quick look at our Js Console as well, you might be familiar with it from the previous exercises. 
in the directory `src/resources/META-INF/` you will find two files that should also be familiar by now.

- index.html

- keycloak.json

Make changes to them by adding your server auth url.

Notice the change in the keycloak.json file

[source, json]
----
{
  "realm" : "quarkus",
  "auth-server-url" : "<SERVER_URL>/auth",
  "resource" : "backend-service",
  "credentials" : {
    "secret" : "secret"
 }
}
----

The new addition here is the credentials field. 
There is a bunch of other properties that can be added to this config json, based on what is being used on the client in keycloak. 
So whats the difference this time? We have added extra credentials to our connection, which means that we expect anyone who is going to authenticate against our system will also add credentials in the call. So just a simple keycloak session on this client will not do. 
This is how it looks in the keycloak console.

image::keycloak_clientconfig.png[Keycloak Template]

<1> Check the Access Type field is not public; rather `confidential` , Also if you look at the `Credentials` Tab you will see the the credentials used.

<2> Also make sure you add the `Root url`, `Redirect URL`, `Admin URL` , `Web Origins` ; the url provided in the screen shot is an example, your URL would be the url for your applicaiton deployed. So lets deploy the application.

To deploy the application lets run the following commands in our CodeReady Terminal

[source, bash]
----

# compiles an uber jar for our quarkus app.
mvn clean package -DuberJar

# create a new build called kstart, we will use the OpenJDK images provided by Red Hat
oc new-build registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift:1.5 --binary --name=kstart -l app=kstart

# Lets start our build, this will deploy our jar file using the OpenJDK image to Openshift
oc start-build kstart --from-file target/*-runner.jar --follow

# create a new app from our newly created image
oc new-app kstart

# expose our service
oc expose svc/kstart

oc get route kstart
----

If all is going well you should now see your application in Openshift console. 

<1> Now if you hit the URL for kstart app, the JS-Console will ask for authentication from the keycloak server. 

<2> What we have also done is that we create a REST request using token and credential to our backend service;

<3> The user/password is alice/alice , you can also reset the user credentials as done in pervious excercises.

<4> Click on user and you will see message appearing showing the User details and the call response from backend service.

Congratulations you have now created a front end application that connects to a backend. 
In this tutorial we used a backend-service Client for our Quarkus realm. And we were able to call our backend from our frontend.
